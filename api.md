## WebSocket API

The WebSocket API allows real-time, bidirectional communication between your application and the Social Stream Ninja server.

### Connecting to the API Server

Connect to the WebSocket server at `wss://io.socialstream.ninja`.

There are two methods to connect and join a session:

1.  Direct connection with parameters:

`ws =  new  WebSocket("wss://io.socialstream.ninja/join/SESSION_ID/IN_CHANNEL/OUT_CHANNEL");`

2.  Connect first, then send a join message:

```
ws =  new  WebSocket("wss://io.socialstream.ninja");
ws.onopen  =  function()  {   
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({  join:  "SESSION_ID",  in:  IN_CHANNEL,  out:  OUT_CHANNEL  }));
};
```

Parameters:

-   `SESSION_ID`: Your unique session identifier (same as used in dock.html or featured.html URL)
-   `IN_CHANNEL`: Channel number to receive messages (optional)
-   `OUT_CHANNEL`: Channel number to send messages (optional)

### Channel System Explained

The channel system allows for more granular control over message routing:

-   Channel 1: Main communication channel (default)
-   Channel 2: Typically used for dock.html communication
-   Channel 3: Often used for extension communication
-   Channel 4: Commonly used for featured.html communication
-   Channel 5: Used for waitlist.html communication
-   Channel 6: Reserved for future use
-   Channel 7: Reserved for future use

When specifying channels, you're defining which channels to receive messages from (IN_CHANNEL) and which to send messages to (OUT_CHANNEL). This allows different components of your setup to communicate on separate channels, reducing noise and improving organization. You can send a content message just to the featured.html page, bypassing the need to send to the dock.html page first, for example.

### Channel-Specific Messaging

You can send messages to specific channels using the `content` action with a channel number:

-   Channel 1: `{"action": "content", ...}`
-   Channel 2: `{"action": "content2", ...}`
-   Channel 3: `{"action": "content3", ...}`
-   Channel 4: `{"action": "content4", ...}`
-   Channel 5: `{"action": "content5", ...}`
-   Channel 6: `{"action": "content6", ...}`
-   Channel 7: `{"action": "content7", ...}`

### HTTP API

The server also supports HTTP GET, POST, and PUT requests for the same actions. Replace `SESSION_ID` with your actual session ID.

-   GET: `https://io.socialstream.ninja/SESSION_ID/ACTION/TARGET/VALUE`
-   POST/PUT: `https://io.socialstream.ninja/SESSION_ID` (with JSON body)
-   POST/PUT: `https://io.socialstream.ninja/SESSION_ID/ACTION` (with JSON body)

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)

Connect to the SSE endpoint to receive real-time updates:

``const eventSource =  new  EventSource(`https://io.socialstream.ninja/sse/SESSION_ID`);``

### Receiving Responses

Include a `get` parameter in your request for actions that require a response:

`{   "action":  "yourAction", "value":  "yourValue", "get":  "uniqueIdentifier" }`

The server will respond with:


`{   "callback":  { "get":  "uniqueIdentifier", "result":  true } }`

Note: Not all commands support or require this callback mechanism.

### Message Targeting System

Social Stream Ninja implements a targeting system that allows messages to be directed to specific instances of the dock or featured pages if multiple of either are open. It still respects messaging channels, offering an additional layer of targetting and filtering for compatible commands. Some commands may not be compatible with this option, but most should be.

#### How it works

1. **URL Parameter**: Each instance (featured/dock) can be given a unique label using the `label` URL parameter.
   
Example: `featured.html?label=stream1` or `dock.html?label=controlpanel1`

2. **Message Structure**: When sending a message through the API, include a `target` field with the label of the intended recipient.

Example:
```
   {
     "action": "someAction",
     "target": "stream1",
     "value": "someValue"
   }
```

2. **Message Processing**: The application checks each incoming message for a target. If the message has a target that doesn't match the instance's label, the message is ignored.

#### Implementation Details
The following code is used in both dock.html and featured.html to implement this system:

```
var thisLabel = false;
if (urlParams.has("label")) {
    thisLabel = urlParams.get("label") || false;
}

// In the message processing function:
if (data.target && data.target !== "null" && data.target !== thisLabel) { 
    return; // does not match, so we assume this isn't for us.
}
```
#### Use Cases

- Running multiple streams with different configurations
- Sending commands to specific control panels
- Updating particular displays without affecting others

This targeting system allows for more flexible and powerful setups, especially in complex streaming environments.
